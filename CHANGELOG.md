# Changelog

All notable changes to **Drip** will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for v0.1
- Public Drip-Bench leaderboard with baseline scores for `dummy`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-4o`, and `drip`.
- **First _live_ Meta write verified on a real ad account** (the `drip apply` write path shipped in 0.0.4 — this is the live-credentials confirmation).
- First Knowledge Pack — `drip-pack-anime` — extra signals + prompt overrides for anime / gacha titles.
- Drip-Bench grows to 20 cases.

## [0.0.5] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Intraday spend-side control — `drip watch`.** The hourly layer above the daily engine: pacing, cost-spike, and budget-exhaustion signals → conservative **throttle / pause / small-raise** actions, every N minutes, through the same gated + audited write path as `drip apply`.
  - `drip.engine.intraday` — `evaluate_intraday` (pace ratio · cost ratio · spike vs baseline · projected exhaustion) + `decide_intraday` (deterministic rules with a rule chain + confidence). ROI is **never** optimised here (ROAS isn't stable intraday); changes stay small to avoid resetting the learning phase, and thin recent samples can't pause or raise.
  - `drip watch [--once] [--interval N]` — runs the cycle; offline on a sample intraday series, live with a token + hourly data. shadow by default.
  - 9 tests for the spend-side signals + rules.

## [0.0.4] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Real Meta write path — `drip apply`.** The first command that pushes decisions to a live platform: collect → diagnose → allocate → **apply**. Each scale/pause becomes a real Meta Marketing API mutate (`facebook-business` SDK, lazy-imported), gated three ways and audited.
  - `drip.adapters.ads.MetaWriter` — maps `SCALE`/`REDUCE` → `daily_budget` (in cents) and `PAUSE` → `status=PAUSED` on a campaign (or adset via `--level adset`). Snapshots the old value first, re-reads after to **verify** the change landed, and is **idempotent** (an already-paused campaign is skipped, not re-written).
  - `drip.safety` — money-safety guards + an append-only audit trail. `DRIP_BUDGET_CAP` caps any single daily budget; new `DRIP_MAX_CHANGE_PCT` (default 0.5) refuses one-step jumps large enough to reset the platform learning phase. Every write (real or shadow) is appended to `DRIP_AUDIT_PATH`.
  - Three-way safety: **shadow** sends nothing · **copilot** prompts y/N per write · **autonomous** (or `--yes`) applies within caps. With no `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, every write is shadow — so `drip apply` runs safely offline.
- 14 tests for the write path and guards (action→params mapping, token gate, idempotency, dry-run, post-write verify, budget/learning-phase caps, audit trail).

### Note
- The write path is implemented and tested; the roadmap's "first live Meta write" is checked once it runs against a real account with your credentials. TikTok/China-platform writers are still shadow (tracked for v0.3).

## [0.0.3] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **`docs/intraday-research.md`** — a research dossier covering three things, in Drip's read-it-don't-trust-us spirit:
  - An honest **capability self-audit** of the open-source build (what's a real deterministic/auditable path vs. what's still a shadow stub or roadmap — e.g. the decision engine, allocator, attribution, and LLM layer are real and offline-runnable; the live ad-platform *write* path is still a v0.2 stub).
  - **Platform "minute-level" capability research** across Meta, Tencent Ads (腾讯广告), Ocean Engine (巨量引擎), Kuaishou (快手磁力), and TikTok — finest report granularity, data latency/retroactive correction, native auto-rule cadence, mutate-API write endpoints, and rate limits, with first-party sources and adversarial fact-checking. Headline: every major platform tops out at **hourly** reporting and **30-min–1-hour** native auto-rules; true "minute-level ROI optimisation" is marketing, while **spend-side pacing/cost-control** is genuinely near-real-time.
  - A **two-tier intraday-control design** (daily strategic layer + an hourly spend-side intraday layer) and a staged plan to wire the real write path.

### Changed
- **Web console (`web/app.html`) overhaul** — unified Manus-style sidebar (collapsible, drag-resizable, identical expanded/collapsed layout with no jump), a settings modal with light/dark/auto theme, a brand-native line-art water-droplet welcome illustration, 12 authored end-to-end UA conversations, platform-logo SVG sprites, a taller chat composer, and a low-key GitHub star button. Punctuation and i18n base strings cleaned up across 10 languages.
- The live demo now points at the chat-driven console (`web/app.html`) rather than the static landing page.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Drip-Bench v0** — open evaluation suite for UA agent decisions.
  - 10 hand-curated cases across `scale_decision`, `pause_decision`, `budget_reallocation`, `creative_fatigue`, `anomaly_diagnosis`, `cohort_quality`, `audience_expansion`, `bid_strategy_switch`, `market_entry`, `crisis_response`.
  - Three-part rubric: `action_match` (0–40) + `direction_match` (0–20) + `reasoning_quality` (0–40, LLM-as-judge with heuristic fallback).
  - Reproducible run bundles in `benchmarks/runs/<timestamp>/`.
- New CLI command group: `drip bench {list, show, run}`.
- Agent adapters in `drip.eval.agents`: `DummyAgent`, `ClaudeAgent`, `DripAgent` (stub forwards to Claude until `BiddingWorker` exposes a `decide(case_json)` entry point — tracked in #4).
- LLM-as-judge in `drip.eval.judges` using the Anthropic Messages API directly via `httpx` (no SDK dep beyond core).
- Heuristic judge fallback (keyword overlap) when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset, so local development never blocks on credentials.
- `benchmarks/README.md` and `benchmarks/SCHEMA.md` documenting the bench design and case YAML contract.

### Changed
- **Repositioned** the project from "anime / gacha vertical" to a general-purpose open reference implementation. The anime / gacha angle survives as a first-party Knowledge Pack (`drip-pack-anime`, landing in v0.1).
- README rewritten — new sections on Drip-Bench, the open-source vs closed-source comparison, and a bench-driven roadmap. English and Simplified Chinese versions in sync.
- `drip eval` is now a deprecated alias for `drip bench run`. It still works; new code should use `drip bench`.

### Deprecated
- `drip eval` CLI verb (hidden, emits a deprecation notice; use `drip bench run` instead).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- Project scaffold (`src/drip/{cli,orchestrator,workers,adapters,eval}/`).
- Four workers: Creative, Audience, Bidding, Reporter.
- Adapters: `gpt-image-2`, Seedance 2.0 (Volc Engine ARK), OASIS, MCP-ready ads stub.
- CLI: `drip launch`, `drip demo`, `drip eval`.
- Three-mode runtime: `shadow` (default) / `copilot` / `autonomous`.
- Budget cap enforcement (`DRIP_BUDGET_CAP`).
- Landing page (`web/index.html`).
- Apache-2.0 license.
